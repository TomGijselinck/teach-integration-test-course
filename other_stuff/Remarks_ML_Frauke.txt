Gille appears to be a bit pink, maybe we can filer that

Exercises
in ex7 error in success_msg: substantionally
in ex12 hint: first hint includes one too many paranthesis, second hint does not makes sense. I think the word arguent is missing in the second sentence
in ex15 - Do you remember what Dunn's index measured => I would use present tense, also in the instructions
		hint is missing
		success_msg: If you think[it] about, it can make sense
However, if you'd like to report your clusters to the local newspapers, then complete linkage or k-means are probably the better choice!
